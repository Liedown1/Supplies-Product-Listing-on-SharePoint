This is two of the main codes i have used for a SharePoint web Page i have created.
The first one is to create a tile system which can be used for dynamic filtering, it makes the tiles unclickable and formats them. needs to be in Gallery view and each list part needs an image attached.
The second branch is to create pop-up cards, you must have the collumns you wish to show in the pop-up card visible and it needs to be in regular list view. (ensure you do not have grid view on otherwise it will not work).
